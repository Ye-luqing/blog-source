**Exercise**:Let $ABC$ be a triangle;$D$ on $BC$,$E$ on $CA$,$F$ on $AB$.$BC\cdot EF=K$,$CA\cdot FD=L$,$AB\cdot DE=M$.Show that if $K,L,M$ are collinear,then $AD,BE,CF$ are cocurrent.


**Proof:**Let $\pi$ be the plane of figure 1.Let $\pi'$ be a plane through a line parallel to $MK$.Let $E^{*}$ be a point on a plane parallel to $\pi'$ passing through $MK$.This makes $MK$ a vanishing line.So $K,M$ disappear.Now in the projected figure 2,letting $A',B',C',\cdots,F'$ represent the images,we have the following:$E'F'$ is parallel to $C'D'$.$A'B'$ is parallel to $D'E'$.And $D'F'$ is parallel to $C'A'$.So it can be easily verified that $A'D',C'F',B'E'$ are the midlines of the triangle $A'B'C'$,so they are cocurrent.So $AD,BE,CF$ are also cocurrent.
