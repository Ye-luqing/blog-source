Let $ABA'B'$ be a complete quadrangle;let $P=AA'\cdot BB'$,$Q=AB'\cdot A'B$,$R=AB\cdot A'B'$ be the diagonal points;and let $D'=PQ\cdot A'B'$,$D=PQ\cdot AB$.We have $H(A,B;R,D)$ and $ABRD\frac{P}{\wedge} A'B'RD'$.Hence by the preceding theorem we also have $H(A',B';R.D')$.Draw this same conclusion directly from the figure,rather than by the above theorem.Also without using that theorem show that $H(P,Q;D',D)$. 
Show: 

(1)Regard $A'B'AB$ as a complete quadrangle.
(2)Regard $PA'QB'$ as a complete quadrangle.


# Fourth harmonic is a projectively invariant concept

In this note we prove that,given a harmonic tetrads $CDFH$,if $H(C,D;F,H)$.And $CDFH\frac{I}{\wedge}C'D'F'H'$,then $H(C',D';F',H')$.

As shown in the figure 2.1,$ABCD$ is a complete quadrangle in the plane $\pi$.$H(C,D;F,H)$.And $CDFH\frac{I}{\wedge}C'D'F'H'$,where $C',D',F',H'$ are on plane $\pi'$.Now we prove that $H(C',D';F',H')$.

There are two methods of proving this theorem.The first proof is three dimensional.In the figure 2.1,$A,B,C,\cdots,H$ are projected to $A'(A),B'(B),C'(C),\cdots,H'$ respectively,where $A',B',C',\cdots,H'$ are on plane $\pi'$,and the center of projection is $I$.It can be easily verified that $A'B'C'D'$ is also a complete quadrangle,and $H(C',D';F',H')$.

The second proof is planar.$H(C,D;F,H)$,so as the figure 2.2 shows,we can construct a complete quadrangle $ABCD$ such that $F=CD\cdot AB$,$G=AD\cdot BC$,$E=AC\cdot BD$,and $H=GE\cdot CD$,$J=GE\cdot AB$.

Also,Let $G‘=AD'\cdot BC'$,$H'=C'D'\cdot G'J$.It can be easily verified that $ABC'D'$ is also a complete quadrangle and $H(C',D',F,H)$.Thus the theorem is proved.
